# Explanation for Incomplete Implementation of QGramIndex in SeqLang

## Overview

The implementation of the `QGramIndex` data structure in SeqLang, aimed at mirroring the functionality present in RustBio, encountered significant challenges due to inherent language limitations and design constraints. Despite rigorous attempts, the final implementation remains incomplete and may contain unresolved bugs and errors.

## Key Challenges

### Circular Dependency

- **Interdependence of Classes**: The `RankTransform` and `QGrams` classes are interdependent, creating a circular dependency. `RankTransform` requires `QGrams` for its `qgrams` method, while `QGrams` depends on `RankTransform` for data access and methods.
- **SeqLang Limitations**: Unlike Rust, which supports advanced features like traits and generics, SeqLang's Pythonic nature lacks these capabilities. This limitation is critical in handling circular dependencies, especially given SeqLang's static typing and compiled nature.

### Language Constraints

- **Static Typing and Compilation**: SeqLang's strict typing and requirement for compile-time resolution make traditional Python runtime solutions for resolving dependencies less viable.
- **Domain-Specific Focus**: As a language tailored for computational genomics and bioinformatics, SeqLang's design imposes unique constraints, influencing the feasibility of certain implementation strategies.

### Design Considerations

- **Adapting to SeqLang's Features**: Traditional methods used in Python to resolve circular dependencies, such as forward declarations or restructuring class designs, prove less effective in SeqLang due to its particular characteristics.
- **Rethinking Class Structures**: The mutual dependencies and SeqLang's specific limitations necessitate a redesign of the class structure, potentially simplifying interactions or reassigning responsibilities to fit within the language's capabilities.

## Conclusion

The attempt to reimplement the `QGramIndex` data structure in SeqLang, similar to its RustBio counterpart, highlights the importance of considering a language's unique features and constraints when designing class structures and dependencies. Due to SeqLang's specific limitations and focus, traditional solutions for handling circular dependencies were not applicable, leading to an incomplete and potentially flawed implementation. This experience underscores the need for language-specific approaches when dealing with complex data structures in domain-focused programming environments like SeqLang.
